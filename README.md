## About
This is the second iteration of my personal website. It's still in beta but so far includes Skills, Experience, Blog and pages generated by Gatsby. Currently hosted on Surge.sh and eventually GitHub Pages.

## Why the move?
My first personal website was created in my endeavor to learn web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby) and generated using Jekyll. Since then new technologies such as React, GraphQL, Node, and more have grabbed my attention. As someone who loves getting their hands dirty, it was a natural step to transform my old project into this one. I also love the thrill of a challenge. I've found many useful resources on Gatsby's site and the online community.
