Today, well... last night technically marks my first steps into Web Dev. After doing a few Google searches and some reading on Reddit I found a plentiful amount of wonderful resources. One in particular that has stood out is [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101). So far it looks like a promising guide to understanding Web Dev. My expectations were originally to understand HTML and CSS but the guide also gives a good intro to Javascript - very exciting!

I am super eager to read further into the guide and do some learning!

On a side note, here's a great video I enjoyed watching that was suggested by the site and produced by [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/talks-and-interviews/conversations-with-sal/a/the-learning-myth-why-ill-never-tell-my-son-hes-smart).
