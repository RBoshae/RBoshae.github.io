It has been very exciting learning the in's and out's of HTML and CSS. It is amazing how powerful CSS can be when designing a site. I found a neat tutorial, written by the [Code Player](http://thecodeplayer.com/), that spotlights some of the controls CSS provides.  Here's an Android logo I built using just HTML and CSS by watching [this cool video](http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-android-logo) from the site.
