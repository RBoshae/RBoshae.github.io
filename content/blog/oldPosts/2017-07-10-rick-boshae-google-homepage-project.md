Alright, another project almost done. I decided to recreate the famous google homepage. This one was a bit tougher since I resisted inspecting the html code. I am glad to say that my work is paying off. Although this project is still a WIP I thought I'd share what I have done so far.

Update 7-11-2017: The project is now complete.
