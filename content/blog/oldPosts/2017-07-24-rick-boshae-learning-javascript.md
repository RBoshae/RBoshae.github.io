Woohoo! I've started incorporating some javascript into my projects. I have to give a big thank you to [code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) for their javascript tutorial. Given my background in programming, it was very easy to pick up. So far I've used javascript to solve problems on ProjectEuler.net and add some cool interactive features to my webpage.
