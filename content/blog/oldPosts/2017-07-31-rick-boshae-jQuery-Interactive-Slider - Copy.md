title: "jQuery Interactive Slider"

Today marks another step forward in my path to web development. Here is an interactive slider I built using html, CSS, javascript, and jQuery. To accompish the task I followed a short series of [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtYP_eSVKfs). The main takeaway from the tutorial is the use of jQuery.

In short, jQuery is a javascript library and a great shortcut to making an interactive website. While following the videos, I noticed that some of the content was outdated so I had to scroll through this [jQuery cheatsheet](http://overapi.com/jquery) to get some parts working properly.

Should you decide to attempt the tutorial yourself be sure to change the bit about '.size()' to '.length' (and yes I purposely excluded the '()' in .length).

Without further ado here's the slider.
