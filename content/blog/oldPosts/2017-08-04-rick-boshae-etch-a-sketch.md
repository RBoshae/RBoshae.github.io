Oh man this project was pretty intense. Here, I've created an interactive cross between an etch-a-sketch and paint. I used html, CSS, javascript, and jQuery to put it together. The project was a lot of fun and quite challenging since there were no tutorials to follow. I was forced to rely on heavy trial and error and Googling! I hope you'll have as much fun playing with this as I did making it.
