title: "Building my first Webapp With React"

School is back in session and keeping up with my blog has been tough. This quarter in particular is a busy one. I'm learning Graphics, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, and Technical Communication. It really is a big time requirement but so much fun. On the plus side, I've gained a new set of skills to sharpen.

A very neat project I've been working on for the past 5 weeks is [Huddle](http://huddlereflex.me/) (-- be nice! Huddle is in alpha ). Inspired by Trello, Huddle is a collaborative tool that organizes projects into boards. Each board is made up of columns (or lists) which hold a set of cards that correspond to user stories or tasks.

I designed the webapp with four other CS students at UC Riverside.
This is one of the first major projects I've worked on with my peers at UCR. It was a great way to practice team skills and dividing a large project into manageable parts. I am super grateful for taking a Software Engineering course and recommend it to everyone.

The best part about building Huddle was learning how to program with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and incorporating [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). If you've been thinking about using React to build a webapp of your own I absolutely recommend it. A big shoutout to Google for Firebase too, it is so great! To get started on React I followed this [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) by the reactjs site. CSS-Tricks has a life saving [Intro to Firebase and React](https://css-tricks.com/intro-firebase-react/) article.
