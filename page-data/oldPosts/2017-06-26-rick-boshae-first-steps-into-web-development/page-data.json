After doing a few Google searches and some reading on Reddit I found a plentiful amount of wonderful resources. One in particular that has stood out is <a href=\"https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101\">The Odin Project</a>. So far it looks like a promising guide to understanding Web Dev. My expectations were originally to understand HTML and CSS but the guide also gives a good intro to Javascript - very exciting!</p>\n<p>I am super eager to read further into the guide and do some learning!</p>\n<p>On a side note, here’s a great video I enjoyed watching that was suggested by the site and produced by <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/talks-and-interviews/conversations-with-sal/a/the-learning-myth-why-ill-never-tell-my-son-hes-smart\">Khan Academy</a>.</p>\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JC82Il2cjqA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe> \n          </div>\n          ","frontmatter":{"title":"First Steps Into Web Development"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/oldPosts/2017-06-26-rick-boshae-first-steps-into-web-development/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/oldPosts/2017-06-23-rick-boshae-site-launched/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rick Boshae, Launches Site"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/oldPosts/2017-06-30-rick-boshae-android-css-project/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Android CSS Project"}}}}}
