This quarter in particular is a busy one. I’m learning Graphics, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, and Technical Communication. It really is a big time requirement but so much fun. On the plus side, I’ve gained a new set of skills to sharpen.</p>\n<p>A very neat project I’ve been working on for the past 5 weeks is <a href=\"http://huddlereflex.me/\">Huddle</a> (— be nice! Huddle is in alpha ). Inspired by Trello, Huddle is a collaborative tool that organizes projects into boards. Each board is made up of columns (or lists) which hold a set of cards that correspond to user stories or tasks.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin: auto;\n    display: flex;\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RBoshae/Personal-Website-1/master/images/Huddle-Board-View.png\" alt=\"Huddle Board View\" height=\"85%\" width=\"85%\"></p>\n<p>I designed the webapp with four other CS students at UC Riverside.\nThis is one of the first major projects I’ve worked on with my peers at UCR. It was a great way to practice team skills and dividing a large project into manageable parts. I am super grateful for taking a Software Engineering course and recommend it to everyone.</p>\n<p>The best part about building Huddle was learning how to program with <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> and incorporating <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a>. If you’ve been thinking about using React to build a webapp of your own I absolutely recommend it. A big shoutout to Google for Firebase too, it is so great! To get started on React I followed this <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html\">tutorial</a> by the reactjs site. CSS-Tricks has a life saving <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/intro-firebase-react/\">Intro to Firebase and React</a> article.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building my first Webapp With React"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/oldPosts/2017-11-25-playing-with-react/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/Breakout/breakout/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Breakout"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/miniGL/minigl/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"MiniGL"}}}}}
