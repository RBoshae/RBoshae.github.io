&lt;p&gt;A year or so ago, I set out to learn Web Development. My first challenge was to create a personal website. Not knowing were to begin, I started Googling, “How to learn web development?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time spent researching I came across a GitHub repo called, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theodinproject.com/&quot;&gt;The Odin Project&lt;/a&gt;. I followed along for quite a while and picked up HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and some Ruby. The learning path set out by The Odin Project is great. Yet, I found myself still lacking fundamental knowledge in JavaScript. This made it very challenging when trying to understand JavaScript specific concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from C++ I didn’t understand what many things meant. Questions I found asking myself were what is ECMAScript? What’s the difference between ES5 and ES6? What does reduce, map, and filter do? Some of the more subtle concepts were easy to miss too like variable context (also called scope.) Of course I Googled all these questions but there were too many cracks in my foundation to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Back To Basics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I was able to build my personal website and some Web Apps I realized it’s time I learn JavaScript the right way. I often find the best way to learn a new programming language is through reading a book. Books are peer reviewed and sometimes include practice problems. You can also start learning about subtle language details that are easy to misunderstand. You’ll be able to answerfundamental questions like: What are the primitive types? What is a reference? What is the proper syntax for flow control statements? How is the data represented in memory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Recommended Reads&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across this &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@yusufbekalimatov/best-books-to-learn-javascript-in-2018-e4fb1369d1b5&quot;&gt;Medium article&lt;/a&gt; that lists 5 recommended books for learning JavaScript by. I started with &lt;em&gt;Eloquent JavaScript&lt;/em&gt;, 2nd Edition Marijn Haverbeke. I read the first chapter and found the book to be better suited for someone new to programming. Next I started reading, &lt;em&gt;Professional JavaScript for Web Developers&lt;/em&gt; by Nicholas C. Zakas. This book fits my needs a little better. The topics are concise and accompanied by excellent code samples. &lt;em&gt;Effective JavaScript&lt;/em&gt; by David Herman will be the next book I look over but so far I’ve been enjoying Zakas’ book. I definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exporting My Personal Website to Gatsby]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why the move?

&lt;p&gt;My first personal website was created in my endeavor to learn web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby) and generated using Jekyll. Since then new technologies such as React, GraphQL, Node, and more have grabbed my attention. As someone who loves getting their hands dirty, it was a natural step to transform my old project into this one. I also love the thrill of a challenge. I’ve found many useful resources on Gatsby’s site and the online community.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Phantom Edge]]></title><description><![CDATA[PhantomEdge A first person Virtual Reality game set in a desert arena that

This quarter in particular is a busy one. I’m learning Graphics, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, and Technical Communication. It really is a big time requirement but so much fun. On the plus side, I’ve gained a new set of skills to sharpen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very neat project I’ve been working on for the past 5 weeks is &lt;a href=&quot;http://huddlereflex.me/&quot;&gt;Huddle&lt;/a&gt; (— be nice! Huddle is in alpha ). Inspired by Trello, Huddle is a collaborative tool that organizes projects into boards. Each board is made up of columns (or lists) which hold a set of cards that correspond to user stories or tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: auto;
    display: flex;&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RBoshae/Personal-Website-1/master/images/Huddle-Board-View.png&quot; alt=&quot;Huddle Board View&quot; height=&quot;85%&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I designed the webapp with four other CS students at UC Riverside.
This is one of the first major projects I’ve worked on with my peers at UCR. It was a great way to practice team skills and dividing a large project into manageable parts. I am super grateful for taking a Software Engineering course and recommend it to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about building Huddle was learning how to program with &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and incorporating &lt;a href=&quot;https://firebase.google.com/&quot;&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve been thinking about using React to build a webapp of your own I absolutely recommend it. A big shoutout to Google for Firebase too, it is so great! To get started on React I followed this &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; by the reactjs site. CSS-Tricks has a life saving &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/intro-firebase-react/&quot;&gt;Intro to Firebase and React&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Breakout]]></title><description><![CDATA[Breakout, the good ol’ Atari game reinvented.

Here, I’ve created an interactive cross between an etch-a-sketch and paint. I used html, CSS, javascript, and jQuery to put it together. The project was a lot of fun and quite challenging since there were no tutorials to follow. I was forced to rely on heavy trial and error and Googling! I hope you’ll have as much fun playing with this as I did making it.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is an interactive slider I built using html, CSS, javascript, and jQuery. To accompish the task I followed a short series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtYP_eSVKfs&quot;&gt;video tutorials&lt;/a&gt;. The main takeaway from the tutorial is the use of jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, jQuery is a javascript library and a great shortcut to making an interactive website. While following the videos, I noticed that some of the content was outdated so I had to scroll through this &lt;a href=&quot;http://overapi.com/jquery&quot;&gt;jQuery cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt; to get some parts working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you decide to attempt the tutorial yourself be sure to change the bit about ‘.size()’ to ‘.length’ (and yes I purposely excluded the ’()’ in .length).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado here’s the slider.&lt;/p&gt;
