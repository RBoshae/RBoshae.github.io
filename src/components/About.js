        <p>
        Hi there, I'm Rick Boshae, a recent college grad living in Los
        Angeles, California. In a nutshell, you can say I am an aspiring
        Software Engineer with the spirit of an entrepreneur. I find everything
        about creating software amazing. The design, development, maintenance,
        and testing wrapped together to ship an awesome product. My favorite
        part of the entire process is exchanging ideas with other engineers.
        With each project I strive to explore new tech while creating something
        akin to magic.
        </p>
        <h3>Areas of Interest</h3>

        involving AI, Machine Learning, Graphics, VR, Networking, Databases,
         Android, and Web Applications.</p>
